# Reversed iteration only works if the object in question has a size that can be determined
# or if the object implements a __reversed__() special method. If neither of these can
# be satisfied, youâ€™ll have to convert the object into a list first

# l = [3,4,5,324,342,54]
# for n in reversed(l):
#     print(n)
# print(l)
